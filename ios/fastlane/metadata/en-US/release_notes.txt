Team's log. Stardate 2108.31:

This time we have pushed live some fixes for ERC-20 balance, we removed the Stake now button from Validators tab, we made the validator page load faster and fixed the dynamic links.

As always, we're here to help! If you come across a problem, want to provide feedback, or require support, you can get in touch through our app or on Twitter.
