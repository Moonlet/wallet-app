Team's log. Stardate 2107.08:

We had to get some fixes live for ZIL, SOL and ETH since some bugs were present on transaction status, pending transactions, and adjusted claiming fees. Let's hope for the best user experience.

As always, we're here to help! If you come across a problem, want to provide feedback, or require support, you can get in touch through our app or on Twitter.
