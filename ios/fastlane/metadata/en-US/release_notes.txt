Teamâ€™s log. Stardate 2005.29:

Howdy! We made some fixes here and there. As well, we are happy to push live the first ZRC-2 token on Zilliqa blockchain, namely XSGD - the Singapore Dollar Stablecoin. And since this is a stablecoin milestone for us, we added DAI into Ethereum dashboard. Oh, we almost forgot! We added a new section in the menu, namely "Scan to pay". Shhh! It's a secret for now. More to come on the next releases. ;)

Thank you,
Moonlet Team
