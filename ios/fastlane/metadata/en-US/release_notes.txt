Team's log. Stardate 2011.16:

We have built a "Claim all" button for all Zilliqa holders. It makes it much easier to claim your rewards. As well we did a few fixes here and there. Ah! We also added CAD to our currency list for all amazing Canadians out there. :)

As always, we're here to help! If you come across a problem, want to provide feedback, or require support, you can get in touch through our app. Just go to Settings > Report issue.
