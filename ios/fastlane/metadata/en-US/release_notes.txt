Team's log. Stardate 2109.17:

This time we have pushed live some fixes for Solana Swap, after the last network upgrade swap transactions were failing because of an unexpected feature activation.

As always, we're here to help! If you come across a problem, want to provide feedback, or require support, you can get in touch through our app or on Twitter.
